Lecture 1 - Objects and classes

--------------------------------

Procedural Programming (POP)
1. Derived from Structural Programming 
2. A program is divided into small parts called functions
3. it follows top down approach
 Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic etc..

Object Oriented Programming(OOPs)
1. OOPs is based on real world
2. Program is divided into small parts called objects
3. it follows bottom up approach
 Examples: C++, Java, Python, C# etc..

-----Objects-----
1. Anything that has a state and behaviour is known as an object.
2. They store data in form of variables and operate on this data using methods/functions
3.An object is an instance of a class

-----Class-----
1. A class is a group of objects which have common properties
2. A class can be seen as a blueprint from which objects are created
3. Classes can contain  Fields, Methods, Constructors, Nested class and interface
